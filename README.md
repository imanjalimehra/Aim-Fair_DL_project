# Lightweight Bias Mitigation using GAN / Augmentation (AIM-Fair Modification)

##  Overview

This project is a modified implementation of the AIM-Fair framework for bias mitigation in deep learning models.

The original AIM-Fair method uses diffusion-based synthetic data generation, which requires high computational resources (e.g., A100 GPUs).
In this project, we replace the diffusion-based approach with a lightweight alternative using data augmentation and simple synthetic strategies.

##  Key Contributions

* Replaced diffusion models with lightweight data augmentation techniques
* Adapted the pipeline to the UTKFace dataset
* Reduced GPU requirements (runs on Colab T4 GPU)
* Maintained comparable accuracy with reduced computational cost

##  Results

### Baseline (AIM-Fair on UTKFace)

* Overall Accuracy: **94.70**
* Worst-group Accuracy: **93.81**
* Equalized Odds: **1.16**
* STD: **0.65**

### Proposed Method (Lightweight / Augmentation)

* Overall Accuracy: **94.55**
* Worst-group Accuracy: **92.88**
* Equalized Odds: **1.52**
* STD: **1.17**

---

##  Analysis

The proposed method achieves performance comparable to the original AIM-Fair model while significantly reducing computational requirements.

* Slight drop in fairness metrics
* Similar overall accuracy
* Much more efficient and reproducible

---

##  Conclusion

This work demonstrates that bias mitigation can be achieved without relying on heavy diffusion models.
Lightweight approaches provide a practical alternative for real-world deployment.

## Note on Results Comparison

The results reported in this repository are not directly comparable 
to the original AIM-Fair paper.

Reasons:
- Different dataset (UTKFace vs CelebA)
- Simplified data pipeline
- Lightweight synthetic data instead of diffusion models
- Reduced dataset size

Therefore, higher accuracy in this implementation does not indicate
better performance, but rather differences in experimental setup.
